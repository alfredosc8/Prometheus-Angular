Gauge (pronounced [geid í]) is used for monitoring changing objects.<br/>
Use case could be observing a cache (its size).<br/>
Metrics are not collected all the time but only when the corresponding endpoint gets called.
<h2>Metric creation</h2>

  <div class="form-group mr-2">
    <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="amount" class="form-control mb-2" id="amount" name="amount">

<h2>TimeGauge</h2>
In addition to the "regular" gauge, measuring in numbers, there is also a special kind of gauge used when the
monitored value is time.<br/>
One use case would be monitoring the drift between two consumers on the same stream. <br/>
Its usage is the same as for the regular gauge but you pass a timeunit and the time function to the builder instead
of the measurement function.
